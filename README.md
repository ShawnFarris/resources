Public notebooks for amie.ai

# Notebooks

There are four notebooks in this repo.

- tutoria.ipynb is the entry point for the amie.ai python client.

The other 3 notebooks serve as a support material for the demo published at amie.ai.

- basic_analysis.ipynb shows how to integrate amie in your descriptive statistic workflow

- ml_integration.ipynb shows how to integrate amie in your machine learning workflow (spoiler: it's really easy)

- hardware_integration.ipynb showcases how to integrate amie with your experimental equipment

Every notebook is meant to be self documenting.

## installation

We use pipenv to manage dependencies, you should use it too.
